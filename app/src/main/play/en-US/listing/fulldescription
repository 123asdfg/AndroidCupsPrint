Have a local printer shared over CUPS or IPP? Then this app allows you to directly print to it from your Android device.

This app just provides a Print Service to Android. This means that once it's installed, you have to enable it from your 'Print' section of the settings app of you device.
Once the service is enabled, the printers are automatically discovered using the mDNS protocol.
You can print anything you want from any app, as long as the print service is enabled.

Of course, printing document is an important matter. Because your documents are your most private information, you don't want anybody to have access to this information.
This is why this app is completely open sourced and free to use, modify and redistribute (under the LGPL license). You can check more on the app website or GitHub repository: http://benoitduffez.github.io/AndroidCupsPrint

This app was only tested with a single CUPS server, running on Debian 8; and with a single printer, an HP Deskjet connected over http.
This means that there is a high probability that you may encounter bugs; in which case you are quite welcome to submit an issue on the GitHub project page: https://github.com/BenoitDuffez/AndroidCupsPrint/issues/new

You can also fork the project and contribute in any way you want.
